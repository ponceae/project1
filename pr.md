1. What I really liked about this website was the overall structure of it. I enjoyed the navigation at the top of the page and the content that was used to create this.
It serves a great purpose for Nick.

2. One significant difference between our projects was definitely the purpose of the site. Yours was a portfolio page where as my website had to do with hosting a
website for my fraternity basketball league. I would say yours has better UX because of the mobile viewport. Mine needs some work. I also think your code was more
maintainable because of the folders. Although I would recommend putting all of your style into a single .css folder for better readability.

3. This question can be answered by my previous answer.

4. No

5. Keep up the good work. This website has a lot of potential.
